Flexbox Pricing Table
This project demonstrates a responsive pricing table built with HTML and CSS using Flexbox. The table is designed to present different subscription plans clearly and attractively.

Main Features
Flexbox Layout:

The layout uses Flexbox for aligning and distributing the pricing plans. Flexbox ensures that the plans are displayed side-by-side on larger screens and can adapt to different screen sizes.
The container .pricing-container uses display: flex;, align-items: center;, and justify-content: space-evenly; to center the plans and provide even spacing.
Responsive Design with Media Queries:

A media query is used to handle smaller screen sizes. When the screen width is 1250px or less, the layout changes from a row to a column to ensure readability and usability on mobile devices.
Modern Look and Feel:

The design uses the "Sono" font from Google Fonts, providing a modern and clean aesthetic.
Each pricing plan is styled with a background color, padding, rounded corners, and a clear, bold font for the titles and prices.
